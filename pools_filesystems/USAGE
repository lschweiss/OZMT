Usage:
  Included with the execution of setup-filesystems.sh

  setupzfs functions are to be used in /{pool}/zfs_tools/etc/pool_filesystems

  setupreplication sets up ssh key distribution and name mapping.   This needs to be run before any replicated
    file systems are defined.

  setupzfs:
  Depricated:
      setupzfs {zfs_path} {zfs_options} {snapshots}

  Prefered:
    setupzfs -z {zfs_path}
      [-o {zfs_option)]           Set zfs property (repeatable)
      [-s {snapshot|count}]       Set snapshot policy and count (repeatable)
      [-n {name}]                 Name for this dataset.   Required for replication.
      [-R {target1|target2|mode|options|freqency}] (repeatable)
                                  Set a replication pair between target1 and target2 (repeatable)
                                    Target is in the form:
                                      {pool}:{folder}
                                        pool is name of the pool associated with the replication target.  It must
                                        have a vIP of the same name and should reside on a backend network or 
                                        VLAN for locally connected hosts.
                                        In an HA environment this should be a vIP associated with the pool not
                                        the replication folder.
                                    Folder is the zfs folder that is being replicated. It does not include the pool name 
                                      associated with the target.
                                    Mode is one of the following:
                                      L     local replication within the same pool
                                      m     mbuffer transport
                                      s     ssh tunnel
                                      b     bbcp transport
                                    Options is specified by include any, all or none of the following:
                                      l     lz4 compress the stream
                                      g     gzip compress the stream
                                      o     encrypt the stream with openssl
                                    Frequency is in the form of ####{unit}
                                      Acceptable units are:
                                      m     minutes
                                      h     hours
                                      d     days
                                      w     weeks

                                    Each pool needs to have a vIP associated with it and resolvable via 
                                    /etc/hosts or DNS.  This means pools with replicated datasets must not 
                                    have the same name.   

                                    All replication targets in receive mode will have snapshot and quota jobs
                                    suspended automatically.

                                    Replication status is stored in ${pool}/var/db/replication/${zfsfolder}

                                    The folder definition must be the same on all replication points.

                                    Each time a zfs folder under replication's configuration is updated, all
                                    target's configuration for the coresponding folder will updated.

                                    Replication can happen in a chain or tree format.  Be careful that loops cannot be formed.

                                    Replication snapshots are generated on the primary target and replicated to all available
                                    targets associated as a replication pair.

                                    A replication snapshot is only deleted when all possible replication jobs using it are
                                    completed successfully.

        [-F {pool:zfs folder}]    Default full ZFS path to be primary. Only effective when first creating replicaiton.

        [-L]                      Failures Limit before halting replication.

                                    can be a positive integer or time in the same form as Frequency

                                    Defaults to 5, unless override specified in zfs-config with 'zfs_replication_failure_limit'


      [-V {vIP/netmask},{pool}|route1,route2,...|host1/ipif1,host2/ipif2,...}] (repeatable)               
                                  The virtual IP that follows this dataset.  Can be in the form of a hostname or raw IP address.
                                    
                                    Each vIP must be unique.

                                    By default a vIP is associated with the active replication target.  If ",{pool}" is
                                    specified, the vIP will be fixed to a specific pool.
                                  
                                    Routes is a comma separated list of static routes to add with this vIP.

                                    Multiple host/ipif mappings can be associated
    
                                    Typically associated with a replication configuration, but not necessarily.    

      [-b {backup_target}]        zfs send/receive target (depricated, being replaced by replication))
                                  {pool}/{zfs_folder} or
                                  {host}:/{pool}/{zfs_folder}  Must have root ssh authorized keys preconfigured.
        [-S {job_schedules}         {job_schedules} ties the backup job to snapshot schedules.   Can be any

                                    {free} can be xx% or in GB, TB.
                                    (repeatable)
      [-t "{trend}|{scope}|{alert_type}|{destination}|{frequency}]
                                  Send a trend alert when daily usage varies more than {trend} percent over a scope
                                    of {scope} days.   Send the alert every {frequency} seconds.
                                    Alert goes to {destination}.

        [-m {target|hostname}]      Target vIP to hostname mapping (repeatable)
                                      For each target a mapping of host(s) which the vIP may be on.
                                      There will be one entry for each host that this dataset can reside on.
                                        For example a primary and DR site.  The primary site has two host for an HA pool.
                                            -m dr-replication01|dr-host

                                            -m pr-replication01|pr-host02
        [-M {target}                Remove a target vIP mapping.
                                      This will remove all entries with the referenced vIP.
                                        Using the above example
                                          -M pr-replication01
                                        would remove both the pr-host01 and pr-host02 entries.
