    ozmt-snapjobs-mod.sh {zfs_folder} {type/count} [{type/count}].. 
      adds new job(s) or modifies existing job(s)

    ozmt-snapjobs-del.sh {zfs_folder} {type} [{type}]..
      deletes job(s) from zfs_folder of {type}

    ozmt-snapjobs-show.sh {zfs_folder} [-r]
      shows all snapshot jobs for {zfs_folder}
        -r  recusively show jobs for all children
  
    Recursive snapshots can be managed by adding an 'r' after {count}.  For example:
      ozmt-snapjobs tank/folder "daily|14r" "weekly|4" "monthly|6"
    will snapshot 'tank/folder' and all of its children folders daily, keeping 14 snapshots,
      4 weekly and 6 monthly snapshots will be kept only on 'tank/folder'

    The folowing snapshot types are managed on this system:
