This is a Userworld Tool (SAS2IRCU) for RAID configuration on LSI SAS2
Controllers that is designed to run from an ESXi host (either from
the shell or via ssh). Running this tool requires manual intervention
by the ESXi administrator, because both the ESXi Shell and ssh are
disabled on ESXi hosts by default.

The Userworld Tool in VIB format can be installed using the
following esxcli command on the ESXi host.

esxcli software vib install --force --vib /tmp/vmware-esx-sas2ircu.vib

Note: Because the vib produced carries no digital signature,
      it must be installed with the "--force" option.

Once installed, the UW Tool can be invoked from the host's ESX Shell by
logging in and issuing the command:

/opt/lsi/bin/sas2ircu
