/*
 * mclt10k.d		MySQL Command Latency Trace.
 *
 * This traces MySQL commands using the mysql DTrace provider.  All
 * mysqld instances on the system will be traced.
 *
 * This emits basic details for consumption by other tools, and includes the
 * MySQL command ID (numeric) and PID.  It ideally captures at least 10,000
 * commands.  It has a 15 minute timeout if that is not possible.
