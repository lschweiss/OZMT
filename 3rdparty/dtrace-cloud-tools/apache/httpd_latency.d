/*
 * httpd_latency.d	Summarize HTTP server latency.
 *
 * This requires the httpd DTrace provider, which is available as mod_usdt
 * for Apache, and the translators.  If they are in not in /usr/lib/dtrace,
 * you may need to invoke this with the actual location with -L, eg:
 * dtrace -L /opt/local/lib/dtrace -s httpdslower.d 
 *
 * This script will trace all running instances of Apache.
