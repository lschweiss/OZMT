DTrace oneliners, scripts (*.d), and example outputs (*.txt) for go lang.

The lib directory can be sourced for argument translation, and provides
variables goarg0..9 for function arguments. Eg, to frequency count the first
argument to the foo() function:

dtrace -Llib -n 'pid$target::main.foo:entry { @[goarg0] = count(); }' -p PID

The go.d file in the lib directory can also be copied into the default DTrace
library search path, which is usually /usr/lib/dtrace, so that "-Llib" is no
longer required.

NOTE: For these to work, they need a fix for the DTrace pid provider so that
it can handle UTF-8 characters:
