# **O**pen **Z**fs **M**anagement **T**ools  **(OZMT)**#

A collection of tools for managing ZFS pools and folders on various OpenZFS platforms.

Historically started as aws_zfs_tools on bitbucket for managing backup replications to ZFS on Linux on EC2.  Evolved over time to manage many aspects of ZFS.

Entirely in bash scripting for portability and ease of extendability.   

Active Features:

1. ZFS folder management

2. Snapshot management

3. ZFS folder replication

    a.  Fail over / Fail back

    b.  Virtual IP (vIP) migration to follow the  replication source

    c.  Currently receives triggers from RSF-1 for vIP failover.  

4.  Backup to Amazon Glacier via ZFS send

5.  Reporting

    a.  Reports on all activity via email.   Tunable on how much is emailed and when.

    b.  Capable of sending alerts when approaching quotas and referenced quotas.  

6.  Parallel rsync replication for migrating from other storage platforms.

    a.  Has specific work for BlueArc/HNAS

    b.  Minor tweaks need to make more generic.  Specifically, finding the snapshot folder. 

Planned Features:

1.  Documentation/Wiki

2.  Job launching service to replace cronjobs

3.  Drive handling tools

4.  Replication with Samba shares, supporting multiple Samba servers each attached to different domains.  

5.  Performance reporting

6.  Integrated HA (Not necessarily in that order)

Inactive Features:

1.  ZFS backup to EC2 - Being integrated in to replication

2.  ZFS backup w/ pre-staged encryption - Too often broken by zfs diff not working properly

Getting started:

1.  mkdir /opt/ozmt

2.  cd /opt/ozmt

3.  hg clone https://bitbucket.org/ozmt/ozmt .

4.  mkdir /etc/ozmt

5.  cp config.example /etc/ozmt/config

6.  Customize the config for your system:
    vim /etc/ozmt/config

7.  Setup email reporting
    cp reporting.muttrc.example /etc/ozmt/reporting.muttrc
    vim /etc/ozmt/reporting.muttrc

8.  Initialize your pools
    ./initialize-pool.sh

9.  Configure folder definitions
    vim /{pool}/zfs_tools/etc/pool-filesystems/*

10. Apply configuration changes
    /opt/ozmt/pool_filesystems/setup-filesystems.sh

11. Setup cron jobs
    crontab -e

Sample crontab:


```
#!cron
